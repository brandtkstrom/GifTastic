This web page uses the GIPHY API to make a dynamic web page that populates with gifs of your choice.

Click a "food" button to find related gifs. More buttons can be added via the text input field.

Clicking the heart in the upper-right corner will add gifs to the top "favorites" section. Gifs marked favorite will persist there until manually removed.

Each gif section can be cleared by clicking the 'X' icon in their respective upper-right corners.
